Okay, so like, just watched It Feeds and... oh man, where do I even start?? 😅 That thing was wild. First of all, who writes this stuff? It's like they downloaded the movie script straight from some horror cliche generator lol. I mean, seriously, every what NOT to do in a horror movie move was there. Just classic.

The whole haunted forest scene – yeah, that was kinda atmospheric, I gotta admit. Like, the fog was doing its thing, and you know me, I'm all about the fog with my landscape designs. If I could bottle that vibe without the creepy, I'd totally use it in a project.😜 But man, did they have to make every character that clueless?

> And the way they all just split up. Have these people never watched a single episode of Scooby-Doo?? Come on, y'all stick together! But nope, they gotta go all solo and then get all surprised when things go south. I was just rolling my eyes halfway through. Anyway.😆

Honestly though, I started wondering what kind of landscaping choices I’d make if I were in charge of that forest set? Let’s be real, I’d throw in some moonlit paths and tucked-away nooks coz it's not creepy enough, right? 😂 And those jumpscares – they worked like twice, maybe? After that, it was just... predictably meh.

Also, the monster design. Like, reallly? Had a major “man in a rubber suit” moment going on. No offense to rubber suits, but in 2023? Give us something legit chilling at least! Man, it’s kind of annoying but also hilarious. How do you even market that kind of villain?? Okay, so definitely not Oscar material here. But it was still fun in a laugh at it way. I still can’t believe they pulled that tree scene. 🤦‍♂️

Oh, and almost forgot – tried to watch the movie without interruptions, but my phone kept buzzing with work texts. So disrespectful to my horror time! 😂 Anyone else get forest in creative projects post-haunt binge? Just me?

printf(Why did I just add this code line here??? LOL);

Honestly, next time we get together, maybe we can just put it on in the background for laughs and sip on something good. 😉 Anyway, hope your evening's chill. Got any horror recs that aren't this ridiculous? I need a palate cleanser! 😅
